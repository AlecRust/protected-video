YouTube/Vimeo player that prevents easy sharing of the video.

== Description ==

Protected Video provides a Gutenberg block for embedding YouTube/Vimeo videos with features that prevent users easily obtaining the original video URL.

An example use case is embedding an "unlisted" YouTube video as premium video course content behind a paywall on your site.

Features:

* Uses [Plyr](https://plyr.io/) as the video player which overlays default player with custom controls
* Includes modifications to prevent default player becoming clickable when paused etc.
* Obfuscates video information in the HTML to prevent users finding it via "View Source"
* Provides a settings page to configure the player theme to match your site's branding

**Note:** This is not foolproof and technical users may still be able to identify the original video URL.

This plugin is open source and contributions are welcome [on GitHub](https://github.com/AlecRust/protected-video).

== Installation ==

1. Install and activate the plugin
2. Optionally configure player theme at **Settings > Protected Video**
2. Search for and use "Protected Video" block in the blocks editor

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What does this plugin do? =

Embeds YouTube/Vimeo videos on your pages and takes steps to prevent users obtaining the original URL to the video, such as by clicking on the player or viewing the page source.

= How secure is this plugin? =

This plugin only provides a basic level of protection against users accessing the default player or otherwise determining the video URL. Technical users may still be able to figure out this information.

= Does this plugin work on mobile? =

Yes, the custom player works on mobile browsers and the disabling of access to the default player is still in place even in fullscreen mode.

= Why not use plain Plyr player? =

The default [Plyr](https://plyr.io/) player overlays YouTube/Vimeo players with its own controls, which prevents access to the underlying video copy/share buttons under some scenarios, but this is a side-effect of the way it works rather than a feature. The goal of Protected Video is to make this a feature by accounting for more scenarios e.g. when the player is paused, and providing additional features such as obfuscation of the original video ID in the HTML.

If you don't care about your users sharing the video or actually want them to, a plugin like [WP YouTube Lyte](https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-youtube-lyte/) is probably more suitable.

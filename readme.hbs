YouTube/Vimeo player that prevents easy sharing of the video.

== Description ==

Gutenberg block and Shortcode for embedding YouTube/Vimeo videos, in a way that prevents users easily accessing the original video.

**This is useful for example when embedding an “unlisted” video as premium course content behind a paywall on your site.**

Features include:

* [Plyr](https://plyr.io/) player used to overlay default player with custom controls
* Player modifications to always prevent clicking the default player
* Encodes video ID in HTML to prevent finding it via “View Source”
* Settings page to configure the player theme to match your site

**Note:** This only provides a basic level of protection. Technical users may still be able to identify the original video URL.

This plugin is open source and contributions are welcome [on GitHub](https://github.com/AlecRust/protected-video).

== Installation ==

1. Install and activate the plugin
2. Optionally configure player theme at **Settings > Protected Video**
3. Search for and use “Protected Video” block in the Block Editor
4. Alternatively use the Shortcode e.g. `[protected_video url="https://youtu.be/c_hO_fjmMnk" service="youtube"]`

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What does this plugin do? =

Embeds YouTube/Vimeo videos on your pages and takes steps to prevent users obtaining the original URL to the video, such as by clicking on the player or viewing the page source.

= How secure is this plugin? =

This plugin only provides a basic level of protection against users accessing the default player or otherwise determining the video URL. Technical users may still be able to figure out this information.

= Does this plugin work on mobile? =

Yes, the custom player works on mobile browsers and the disabling of access to the default player is still in place even in fullscreen mode.

= Why not use plain Plyr player? =

The default [Plyr](https://plyr.io/) player overlays YouTube/Vimeo players with its own controls, which prevents access to the underlying video copy/share buttons under some scenarios, but this is a side-effect of the way it works rather than a feature. The goal of Protected Video is to make this a feature by accounting for more scenarios e.g. when the player is paused, and providing additional features such as obfuscation of the original video ID in the HTML.

If you don't care about your users sharing the video or actually want them to, a plugin like [WP YouTube Lyte](https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-youtube-lyte/) is probably more suitable.

= Why is there a Shortcode as well as Gutenberg block? =

Not everyone likes to use the Block Editor. Others may be using a different page builder that does not support blocks. The Shortcode is provided as an alternative way to embed the video that still provides the same level of protection.

= How can I set the dimensions of the player? =

The [Plyr](https://plyr.io/) player is responsive by default and will grow to fill the container it is placed in. If you'd like to restrict these dimensions, place the block or shortcode within a container that has your desired dimensions. See [this support topic](https://wordpress.org/support/topic/video-size-on-page/) for more.

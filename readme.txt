YouTube/Vimeo player that prevents easy sharing of the video.

== Description ==

Gutenberg block and Shortcode for embedding YouTube/Vimeo videos, in a way that prevents users easily accessing the underlying video.

**This is useful for example when embedding an “unlisted” video as premium course content behind a paywall on your site.**

Features include:

* [Plyr](https://plyr.io/) player used to overlay default player with custom controls
* Player modifications to always prevent clicking the default player
* Encodes video ID in HTML to prevent finding it via “View Source”
* Settings page to configure the player theme to match your site

[View Player Demo](https://protected-video.alecrust.com/)

**Note:** This only provides a basic level of protection. Technical users may still be able to access the underlying video.

This plugin is open source and contributions are welcome [on GitHub](https://github.com/AlecRust/protected-video).

== Installation ==

1. Install and activate the plugin
2. Optionally configure player theme at **Settings > Protected Video**
3. Search for and use “Protected Video” block in the Block Editor
4. Alternatively use the Shortcode e.g. `[protected_video url="https://youtu.be/c_hO_fjmMnk" service="youtube"]`

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What does this plugin do? =

Embeds YouTube/Vimeo videos on your pages and takes steps to prevent users obtaining the e.g. YouTube URL of the video by clicking on the player or viewing the page source.

Watch [this YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVL0z9pO60I) for an introduction to the plugin and its potential use cases.

= How secure is this plugin? =

This plugin only provides a basic level of protection against users accessing the default player or otherwise determining the video URL. Technical users may still be able to figure out this information.

= Does this plugin work on mobile? =

Yes, the custom player works on mobile browsers and the disabling of access to the default player is still in place even in fullscreen mode.

= Why not use plain Plyr player? =

The default [Plyr](https://plyr.io/) player overlays YouTube/Vimeo players with its own controls, which prevents access to the underlying video copy/share buttons under some scenarios, but this is a side-effect of the way it works rather than a feature. The goal of Protected Video is to make this a feature by accounting for more scenarios e.g. when the player is paused, and providing additional features such as obfuscation of the underlying video ID in the HTML.

If you don't care about your users sharing the video or actually want them to, a plugin like [WP YouTube Lyte](https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-youtube-lyte/) is probably more suitable.

= How can I style the player with CSS? =

The main color of the player can be configured at **Settings > Protected Video**. If you'd like to style the player further, you can provide your own CSS to override [the player's CSS variables](https://github.com/sampotts/plyr#customizing-the-css):

= Can the YouTube watermark/controls be hidden? =

Unfortunately not. This plugin loads the standard YouTube player behind the overlay, which we have no control over. These aspects of the YouTube player cannot be disabled.

= Can you add feature X to the player? =

This plugin embeds the [Plyr](https://plyr.io/) player in a particular way and adds modifications to prevent access to the underlying video player. This plugin cannot provide additional features to the player itself beyond what is provided by Plyr. If you'd like to see a feature added to the player, please [open an issue on Plyr's GitHub](https://github.com/sampotts/plyr/issues).

= Why is there a Shortcode as well as Gutenberg block? =

The Shortcode is provided as an alternative embed method that still provides the same level of protection. Some people need the Shortcode for use with 3rd party page builders (Elementor etc.) and others simply prefer using a Shortcode over Gutenberg blocks.

= How do I use the Shortcode embed method? =

This is the format to use if you'd like to use the Shortcode embed method:

`
[protected_video url="https://youtu.be/c_hO_fjmMnk" service="youtube"]
`

A `service` of either `youtube` or `vimeo` must be specified when using the Shortcode embed method.

= How can I set the dimensions of the player? =

The [Plyr](https://plyr.io/) player is responsive by default and will grow to fill the container it is placed in. If you'd like to restrict these dimensions, place the block or shortcode within a container that has your desired dimensions. See [this support topic](https://wordpress.org/support/topic/video-size-on-page/) for more.

`
<style>
:root {
--plyr-badge-background: #000;
--plyr-control-radius: 5px;
}
</style>
`

= The display of the player is broken/it doesn't work =

If the player is not looking or behaving like [the demo](https://protected-video.alecrust.com/) on your site, this indicates another theme or plugin is interfering with Protected Video.

This is usually caused by another plugin or theme loading its own version of [Plyr](https://plyr.io/), which interferes with the Plyr version provided by Protected Video. Please try disabling all other plugins and switching to a default theme to isolate what is causing this issue.

== Screenshots ==

1. Protected Video block in the Block Editor.
2. Configuration of the player theme in plugin settings.
3. Optional usage as Shortcode.
4. Display of the player in the public facing site.
